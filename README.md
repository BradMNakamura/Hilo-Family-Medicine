# ElationAutoImporter
Purpose:
Data entry is a tedious but mandatory task for Hilo Family Medicine. Hilo Family Medicine receives around 100 faxes per day to be entered into an Electronic Health Record (EHR).
Every worker at Hilo Family Medicine takes a few hours each day to rename and upload properly. ElationAutoImporter is a tool that automates the data entry process and renames tens of files in seconds, removing the data entry process and saving Hilo Family Medicine around 50 hours per day!

In this demonstration 57 files were able to be parsed and renamed properly in 18 seconds! This process would have taken a Hilo Family Medicine worker around two hours to finish.
